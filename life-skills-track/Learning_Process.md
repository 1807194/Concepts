# Learning Process

## Question 1 : What is the Feynman Technique?

Feyman Technique is a technique which can be used to learn or grasp a cocept faster. The technique is to 'Explain' the concept learnt, to someone or to yourself. In other words, it says to 'Explain' as if you are teaching the concept to someone.

## Question 2 : In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me is the concept of focus mode and diffuse mode. The use of pinball game to make us understand these concepts, really made it iteresting to me.

## Question 3 : What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

In simple words, active mode is when one is really foccused on some work they are doing. Diffused mode is when one is really not focused and the mind is in a much more relaxed state, so when our mind is in this mode we tend to think everything at a time, or simply we shift from one thought to another really fast.

## Question 4 : According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

1. **Deconstruct the Skill**: Break down the skill into manageable parts.
2. **Learn Enough to Self-Correct**: Gain enough knowledge to identify and fix mistakes.
3. **Remove Barriers to Practice**: Eliminate obstacles that hinder your practice.
4. **Practice for at Least 20 Hours**: Commit to a minimum of 20 hours of focused practice.

## Question 5 : What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

1. Learning the concepts using 'Feynman' technique.
2. To control the brain, or in other words to manage the focus and diffuse modes.
3. While learning a new concept, follow the steps mentioned in the previous answer.
