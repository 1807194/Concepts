# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Question 1

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?<br>

**Answer**- The most interesting idea in the video was how small changes can lead to significant behavior shifts over time. Fogg's emphasis on the importance of simplicity in forming new habits by starting with tiny, manageable actions, stood out. His approach to habit formation by focusing on ease and consistency rather than motivation was particularly compelling. The story about the "Tiny Habits" method, where people begin with very small actions (like flossing one tooth or doing one push-up), highlights how these small steps can eventually lead to substantial and lasting change.

### Question 2

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.<br>

**Answer**- B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make new habits easier, we can focus on the following components:

- M (Motivation): Ensure that we have a reason to perform the behavior. This can be driven by an outcome we desire or an inherent interest.
- A (Ability): Simplify the behavior to make it easier to perform. This means removing obstacles and making the action as simple as possible.
- P (Prompt): Use triggers that remind us to perform the behavior. Prompts can be anything that cues us to take action, like a time of day, a specific location, or an event.
  By optimizing these three elements, we can design our environment and routine to support the formation of new habits more effectively.

### Question 3

Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)<br>

**Answer**- Celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior through positive emotions. This concept, known as "Shine," helps to solidify the new habit in our brain by associating it with a feeling of accomplishment and joy. The act of celebration triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward, which strengthens the habit loop and makes it more likely that we'll repeat the behavior in the future.

### Question 4

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?<br>

**Answer**- The most interesting idea in the video was the concept of marginal gainsâ€”how making small, consistent improvements each day can lead to significant progress over time. The story of the British cycling team's transformation by focusing on tiny, incremental changes in all areas of their training and equipment was particularly inspiring. This approach demonstrates the power of compound growth, where even 1% improvements, when added up, can lead to extraordinary results.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Question 5

What is the book's perspective about Identity?<br>

**Answer**- "Atomic Habits" emphasizes that the key to building lasting habits is to focus on becoming the type of person we want to be, rather than just achieving a specific outcome. The book suggests that habits should be a reflection of our identity and that every action we take is a vote for the type of person we wish to become. By aligning our habits with our identity, we create a stronger, more sustainable foundation for behavior change.

### Question 6

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?<br>

**Answer**-
The book suggests several strategies to make a habit easier to do:

- Reduce Friction: Decrease the number of steps between us and our good habits. For example, if we want to read more, place books in easily accessible locations around our home.
- Prime Your Environment: Design our environment to support our new habits. For instance, if we want to eat healthier, stock our kitchen with nutritious foods and remove unhealthy snacks.
- Simplify the Behavior: Start with a very small version of the habit. If we want to start exercising, begin with just a few minutes a day. This lowers the barrier to entry and makes it easier to get started.

### Question 7

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?<br>

**Answer**-
To make a habit harder to do, the book recommends the following strategies:

- Increase Friction: Add more steps between us and our bad habits. For example, if we want to watch less TV, unplug the TV after each use and store the remote in a different room.
- Design our Environment: Make our environment less conducive to bad habits. For instance, if we want to stop eating junk food, avoid buying it altogether so it's not available at home.
- Use Commitment Devices: Create barriers that make it difficult to engage in undesirable behaviors. This could involve using tools like website blockers to limit time spent on distracting websites.

### Question 8:

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?<br>

**Answer**-
One habit I would like to do more of is daily exercise. Steps to make this habit more consistent include:

- Make the Cue Obvious: Set a specific time for exercise each day and lay out workout clothes the night before.
- Make the Habit Attractive: Choose a form of exercise that I enjoy, such as dancing or playing a sport, to increase motivation.
- Make the Habit Easy: Start with short, manageable workouts, gradually increasing the duration and intensity as the habit becomes more ingrained.
- Make the Response Satisfying: Track progress in a fitness app and celebrate milestones, such as completing a certain number of workouts in a month.

### Question 9:

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?<br>

**Answer**-
One habit I would like to eliminate is mindless scrolling on social media. Steps to reduce this habit include:

- Make the Cue Invisible: Remove social media apps from the home screen of my phone and log out after each use to make access less convenient.
- Make the Process Unattractive: Use apps that track and limit screen time, setting daily limits for social media use and employing grayscale mode to make the interface less visually appealing.
- Make the Process Hard: Keep the phone in a different room during work or study hours to reduce temptation.
- Make the Response Unsatisfying: Reflect on how excessive social media use affects my productivity and well-being, reinforcing the negative impact of the habit.
